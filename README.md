To identify which PS1 files and Ubuntu commands were essential for the successful setup of your Hyper-V Ubuntu VM, I'll review the project knowledge and highlight the key components. Then, I'll point out any files that may be unnecessary for your specific setup.

Key PS1 Files:

1. Create-UbuntuVM.ps1:
This script was crucial for creating the initial VM. It includes error handling, modularity, and clear output, which align with best practices.

2. Access-VMConsole.ps1:
This script was important for accessing the VM console to complete the Ubuntu installation and initial setup.

3. NAT-for-VM.ps1:
This script set up NAT for internet access, which was crucial for the VM's connectivity.

4. Ubuntuy-VM-Access-and-Network-Setup.ps1:
This script combines VM access and network setup, including NAT configuration. It's a more comprehensive version that incorporates elements from Access-VMConsole.ps1 and NAT-for-VM.ps1.

Key Ubuntu Commands and Files:

1. Netplan Configuration (/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml):
This file was crucial for configuring the network settings within the Ubuntu VM.

2. Network Manager Status Check:
The command `systemctl status NetworkManager` was used to ensure Network Manager was running and managing the network interface.

3. IP Configuration Check:
Commands like `ip addr show eth0` and `ip route` were used to verify the network configuration within the VM.

Unnecessary or Redundant Files:

1. Check-Networking.ps1:
While useful for troubleshooting, this script isn't essential for the initial setup if everything works correctly.

2. Connect-VM-to-External-Switch.ps1:
This script might be unnecessary if you're using NAT for internet access. It's more relevant if you decide to switch to an external network later.

3. Create-External_Switch.ps1:
If you're using NAT, creating an external switch isn't necessary for the initial setup.

4. Verify-VM-IP.ps1:
This script is more for verification and troubleshooting rather than essential setup.

5. VM-Network-Configuration.ps1:
This script focuses on external switch configuration, which isn't necessary if you're using NAT.

In conclusion, the essential files for your setup were:
- Create-UbuntuVM.ps1
- Access-VMConsole.ps1 or Ubuntuy-VM-Access-and-Network-Setup.ps1 (which is more comprehensive)
- NAT-for-VM.ps1 (unless its functionality is covered in Ubuntuy-VM-Access-and-Network-Setup.ps1)

The Ubuntu configuration files and commands listed were all relevant for the setup.

The other PS1 files, while potentially useful for troubleshooting or alternative configurations, weren't strictly necessary for the basic setup you've described. However, keep in mind that they might become useful if you encounter issues or decide to change your network configuration in the future.
